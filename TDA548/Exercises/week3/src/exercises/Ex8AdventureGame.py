# package exercises

# For an extra fun challenge: implement a text-based adventure game, in the style of
# Interactive Fiction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)
#
# For this exercise you will need to have understood the following concepts:
# - Reading and parsing user input (commands)
# - Defining classes and creating objects (e.g. locations, items, creatures, ...)
# - Working with structures (e.g. lists)
# - Updating object state (e.g. when the player affects the world)
# - ... and more, depending on how you choose to implement the game
def adventure_game():
    # TODO this file is your canvas, make it beautiful
