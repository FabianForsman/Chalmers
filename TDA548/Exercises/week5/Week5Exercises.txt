Exercises
---------

1.  See ex1useaclass directory. Implement the class Rational so that all tests
    in Ex1TestRational pass.

    TIP: Always store rationals in shortest form,
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm

2.  See ex2usemoreclasses. Implement classes Point and Triangle so that all test
    in Ex2TestPointTriangle passes. Triangle should use Point and should use Heron's
    formula to calculate the area, See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula

4.  See directory ex4hangman. Implement a text based object-oriented version of the Hangman game
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game).

    - All classes needed are there.
    - Break down and decide which data and which methods should go in which classes.
    - The top-level class, with the game loop, is CLI (also contains all IO)
    - Let CLI do calls on the HangMan class (only) to do the work. Hangman will in
      turn delegate to other objects to fulfill their part of the work.
    - Make a sketch, discuss with assistants

    A run of the game outputs:

    Welcome to HangMan, try to guess the word! It's 7 characters long
    Enter a character > i

    i _ _ _ _ _ _
    Enter a character > x
    ---|

    i _ _ _ _ _ _
    Enter a character > n
    ---|

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a character > x
    ---|
       |

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a character > x
    ---|
       |
       O

    ... (etc)

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a character > x
    ---|
       |
       O
      /|\
      /
    i n _ _ _ n _
    Enter a character > x
    ---|
       |
       O
      /|\
      / \

    i n _ _ _ n _
    Sorry you lost. Word was: instans

    (if win: Congratulations, you made it! Word was ..)


5.  See Ex5SplitList. Implement a method to partition a list into sub-lists.

6.  See Ex6Grouping. Group a list of Positions (row, col) into sub-lists in which all
    positions have the same row. You should use a dictionary.

7.  See Ex7NetworkGame. For more challenge. Implement a two-player (or more) game,
    for instance Rock-Paper-Scissors, that uses a server and a client to let two
    players face each other.
